# ADR-009: LLM-Optimized Project Structure for Strategic Reasoning

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context

As LLMs become increasingly involved in software development and strategic decision-making, we need to consider how project structure affects their ability to reason about:

1. **Technical Evolution**: Understanding current architecture and suggesting improvements
2. **Feature Development**: Identifying gaps and opportunities in the product
3. **Market Positioning**: Analyzing competitive landscape and user needs
4. **Community Building**: Understanding stakeholder relationships and growth strategies

Traditional project documentation often scatters strategic context across multiple files, making it difficult for LLMs to build coherent mental models of the project's trajectory and potential.

## Decision

Implement an LLM-optimized project structure that explicitly supports strategic reasoning by:

### 1. **LLM-Generated Strategic Context**
- Use LLMs to write and maintain `docs/strategy/` documents
- Leverage LLMs' ability to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Enable continuous strategic analysis and updates through AI assistance
- Maintain human oversight and validation of strategic direction

### 2. **Decision Traceability**
- Link ADRs to strategic goals and market conditions
- Maintain decision trees showing how technical choices support business objectives
- Document rejected alternatives with reasoning for future reference
- Use ADRs as the primary decision documentation (no separate decisions directory)

### 3. **Market and User Context**
- Create structured personas and use case documents
- Maintain competitive analysis in machine-readable formats
- Document user feedback patterns and feature requests systematically
- Enable LLMs to identify patterns and trends in user behavior

### 4. **Community and Ecosystem Mapping**
- Document stakeholder relationships and dependencies
- Track community engagement metrics and growth patterns
- Maintain ecosystem integration opportunities and partnerships
- Use LLMs to analyze community sentiment and engagement trends

### 5. **LLM-Friendly Documentation Patterns**
- Use consistent section headers and metadata tags
- Include explicit reasoning chains and decision criteria
- Maintain chronological context for evolution tracking
- Provide clear success metrics and evaluation criteria

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved LLM Reasoning**: Structured context enables better strategic analysis
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members and AI assistants can quickly understand project trajectory
- **Better Decision Making**: Clear traceability between technical and business decisions
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Centralized strategic information reduces cognitive load
- **Future-Proofing**: Structured data enables automated analysis and trend detection
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: LLMs handle information synthesis while humans provide oversight
- **Continuous Strategic Analysis**: AI can continuously analyze and update strategic context

### Negative
- **LLM Dependency**: Risk of over-reliance on AI-generated strategic content
- **Quality Control**: Need for human validation of AI-generated strategic documents
- **Context Drift**: AI-generated content may drift from original project vision
- **Tool Dependency**: Reliance on specific documentation formats and LLM capabilities

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **Human Oversight Framework**
- Regular human review of AI-generated strategic content
- Clear approval workflows for strategic document updates
- Version control and change tracking for strategic documents
- Human validation of critical strategic decisions

### 2. **Hybrid Content Generation**
- Use LLMs for initial drafts and analysis
- Human experts provide final validation and approval
- Collaborative editing between humans and AI
- Clear attribution of AI vs human contributions

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated consistency checks for strategic documents
- Cross-reference validation between technical and strategic decisions
- Regular audits of AI-generated content accuracy
- Feedback loops to improve LLM strategic reasoning

### 4. **Flexible Documentation Standards**
- Allow for creative exploration while maintaining structure
- Regular review and update of documentation standards
- Balance between automation and human creativity
- Adapt documentation patterns based on project evolution

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
1. Create `docs/strategy/` directory structure
2. Establish LLM prompt templates for strategic document generation
3. Set up human oversight and approval workflows
4. Link existing ADRs to strategic goals

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Short-term)
1. Implement LLM-assisted strategic document generation
2. Create automated consistency and quality checks
3. Establish regular strategic review processes
4. Develop feedback mechanisms for LLM improvement

### Phase 3: Integration (Medium-term)
1. Integrate strategic context into development workflows
2. Create automated impact analysis for proposed changes
3. Develop community feedback integration systems
4. Implement strategic metric tracking and reporting
