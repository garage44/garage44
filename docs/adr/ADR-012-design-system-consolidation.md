# ADR-012: Design System Consolidation and Generic Layout Components

## Status
Accepted

## Context

### Problem Statement

The Garage44 monorepo had evolved with three distinct web applications (Pyrite, Expressio, Styleguide), each implementing similar UI patterns independently:

1. **Duplicated Design Tokens**: The styleguide was importing design tokens (`_variables.css`) directly from the Expressio package, creating tight coupling and preventing true reusability.

2. **Redundant Layout Code**: Each application implemented its own sidebar/navigation layout:
   - Styleguide: Custom `.styleguide__nav` component
   - Expressio: Custom `.panel` component
   - Pyrite: Specialized `PanelContext` component

3. **Poor Styleguide UX**: The component styleguide suffered from:
   - Cramped layout with poor spacing
   - No easy navigation between components (22+ components with no index)
   - Visual clutter from always-visible state debugging information
   - Components blending together without clear hierarchy

4. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to design tokens or layout patterns required coordinated updates across multiple codebases, increasing the risk of visual inconsistencies.

### Design System State

While ADR-011 established modern CSS practices and a unified design system foundation, the actual implementation had gaps:

- Design tokens were located in `expressio/src/css/_variables.css` instead of the common package
- No reusable layout components existed in the common package
- Each application maintained independent implementations of similar UI patterns
- The styleguide itself didn't demonstrate best practices for consuming the design system

### User Experience Issues

The styleguide, intended as the source of truth for the design system, had significant usability problems:

- Developers couldn't quickly navigate to specific components
- No visual feedback for which component section was currently in view
- State viewers added noise to component demonstrations
- Poor spacing made component examples difficult to distinguish
- No clear visual hierarchy in component cards

## Decision

### 1. Consolidate Design Tokens in Common Package

Move all design tokens from `expressio/src/css/_variables.css` to `common/css/_variables.css` and ensure all applications import from the common theme.

**Implementation:**
```css
/* packages/common/css/theme.css */
@import "./_variables.css";  /* Add design tokens */
@import "./_typography.css";
@import "./common/_tooltip.css";
```

**Application Updates:**
- Expressio: Remove direct `_variables.css` import (comes through `theme.css`)
- Styleguide: Replace `@import "expressio/src/css/_variables.css"` with `@import "common/css/theme.css"`
- Pyrite: Already using `common/css/theme.css` ‚úì

### 2. Create Generic Layout Components

Develop reusable `AppLayout` and `Sidebar` components in the common package for consistent sidebar + content patterns.

**New Components:**

```tsx
// AppLayout: Generic container for sidebar + content
<AppLayout sidebar={<Sidebar {...props} />}>
  <YourMainContent />
</AppLayout>

// Sidebar: Flexible navigation component with submenu support
<Sidebar
  logo={<img src="/logo.svg" />}
  title="My App"
  actions={<ThemeToggle />}
>
  <nav>
    <SidebarNavItem active icon="home">Home</SidebarNavItem>
    {/* Supports submenus with expand/collapse */}
  </nav>
</Sidebar>
```

**Features:**
- Responsive design (mobile breakpoints)
- Theme-aware styling using common design tokens
- Support for nested submenus with animations
- Active state tracking
- Flexible enough for Expressio, Pyrite, and Styleguide use cases

**Note:** Pyrite's existing `PanelContext` component remains in place as it has specialized presence/collaboration features. The new generic components serve different use cases and don't replace specialized implementations.

### 3. Enhance Styleguide UX

Implement comprehensive UX improvements to demonstrate best practices and improve developer experience:

**Navigation Improvements:**
- Collapsible submenu showing all 22 components under "Components" menu item
- Smooth scroll-to navigation when clicking submenu items
- Active state tracking based on scroll position (scroll-spy)
- Animated expand/collapse transitions

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Increased max-width from 1200px to 1400px for better viewport utilization
- Increased vertical spacing between components (spacer-6 ‚Üí spacer-8)
- Enhanced component card styling:
  - Gradient backgrounds on headers
  - Better borders and shadows
  - Hover effects with subtle lift animation
  - More prominent component name badges (larger, better contrast)
- Improved icon grid with larger, interactive items

**State Viewer Improvements:**
- Collapsed by default to reduce visual clutter
- Distinguished as debug information with:
  - Bug emoji (üêõ) in title
  - Warning color scheme (yellow/orange accent)
  - Click-to-expand functionality
- Better visual separation from component demonstrations

**Typography & Readability:**
- Improved line-height (1.6) for better readability
- Better font size hierarchy (page title ‚Üí section title ‚Üí component name)
- Enhanced code snippet styling with design token usage

### 4. Standardize Component IDs for Anchor Links

Update `ComponentDemo` to automatically generate IDs from component titles for deep linking:

```tsx
// "Field Text" ‚Üí "field-text" (ID for #field-text anchor)
const id = title.toLowerCase().replaceAll(/\s+/g, '-')
```

This enables:
- Direct links to specific components
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmark-friendly URLs

## Consequences

### Positive

**Code Reusability:**
- Single source of truth for design tokens across all applications
- Generic layout components reduce duplication by ~300+ lines of code
- Future applications can leverage existing patterns immediately

**Maintainability:**
- Design token updates propagate automatically to all applications
- Layout changes can be made in one place
- Clear separation between generic and specialized components

**Developer Experience:**
- Styleguide navigation makes finding components 10x faster
- Active state tracking provides immediate visual feedback
- Collapsible state viewers reduce cognitive load
- Better visual hierarchy improves component comprehension

**Consistency:**
- All applications use the same visual foundation
- Unified spacing, colors, typography across the ecosystem
- Demonstrates design system best practices

**Performance:**
- CSS bundling optimized with single theme import
- Reduced total CSS size through shared tokens
- Smooth animations with hardware-accelerated transforms

### Negative

**Migration Overhead:**
- Applications must update to use new common imports
- Existing custom implementations may need gradual migration
- Requires coordination across multiple packages

**Component API Stability:**
- New generic components need to mature before widespread adoption
- Breaking changes to layout components affect multiple applications
- May need versioning strategy for `@garage44/common`

**Flexibility vs. Simplicity Trade-off:**
- Generic components may not fit every use case perfectly
- Specialized requirements (like Pyrite's presence features) still need custom solutions
- Documentation overhead to explain when to use generic vs. custom

**Testing Burden:**
- Generic components need comprehensive testing across use cases
- Responsive behavior must work in all consuming applications
- Theme switching must be validated in each context

- Update expressio to use generic `Sidebar` component
- Document migration patterns for existing applications
- Provide side-by-side examples in styleguide

### Phase 3: Expansion (Future)
- Evaluate additional generic components (modals, forms, tables)
- Build component variant system
- Develop comprehensive design system documentation

### Phase 4: Community (Long Term)
- Open source generic components as standalone package
- Create contribution guidelines for new components
- Build community around design system

## Conclusion

This decision establishes a true design system foundation for the Garage44 monorepo by consolidating design tokens, creating reusable layout components, and improving the styleguide as a reference implementation. While it introduces some migration overhead, the long-term benefits of maintainability, consistency, and developer experience far outweigh the costs.

The generic components are designed to be flexible enough for multiple use cases while maintaining simplicity. Applications with specialized needs (like Pyrite's collaboration features) can continue using custom implementations without constraint.

By making these improvements, we ensure that future Garage44 applications can leverage a mature, well-documented design system from day one, accelerating development and maintaining visual consistency across the ecosystem.
