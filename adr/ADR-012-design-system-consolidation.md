## Context

### Problem Statement

The Garage44 monorepo had evolved with three distinct web applications (Pyrite, Expressio, Styleguide), each implementing similar UI patterns independently:

1. **Duplicated Design Tokens**: The styleguide was importing design tokens (`_variables.css`) directly from the Expressio package, creating tight coupling and preventing true reusability.

2. **Redundant Layout Code**: Each application implemented its own sidebar/navigation layout:
   - Styleguide: Custom `.styleguide__nav` component
   - Expressio: Custom `.panel` component
   - Pyrite: Specialized `PanelContext` component

3. **Poor Styleguide UX**: The component styleguide suffered from:
   - Cramped layout with poor spacing
   - No easy navigation between components (22+ components with no index)
   - Visual clutter from always-visible state debugging information
   - Components blending together without clear hierarchy

4. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to design tokens or layout patterns required coordinated updates across multiple codebases, increasing the risk of visual inconsistencies.

### Design System State

While ADR-011 established modern CSS practices and a unified design system foundation, the actual implementation had gaps:

- Design tokens were located in `expressio/src/css/_variables.css` instead of the common package
- No reusable layout components existed in the common package
- Each application maintained independent implementations of similar UI patterns
- The styleguide itself didn't demonstrate best practices for consuming the design system

### User Experience Issues

The styleguide, intended as the source of truth for the design system, had significant usability problems:

- Developers couldn't quickly navigate to specific components
- No visual feedback for which component section was currently in view
- State viewers added noise to component demonstrations
- Poor spacing made component examples difficult to distinguish
- No clear visual hierarchy in component cards

## Decision

### 1. Consolidate Design Tokens in Common Package

Move all design tokens from `expressio/src/css/_variables.css` to `common/css/_variables.css` and ensure all applications import from the common theme.

**Implementation:**
```css
/* packages/common/css/theme.css */
@import "./_variables.css";  /* Add design tokens */
@import "./_typography.css";
@import "./common/_tooltip.css";
```

**Application Updates:**
- Expressio: Remove direct `_variables.css` import (comes through `theme.css`)
- Styleguide: Replace `@import "expressio/src/css/_variables.css"` with `@import "common/css/theme.css"`
- Pyrite: Already using `common/css/theme.css` ‚úì

### 2. Create Generic Layout Components

Develop reusable `AppLayout` and `Sidebar` components in the common package for consistent sidebar + content patterns.

**New Components:**

```tsx
// AppLayout: Generic container for sidebar + content
<AppLayout sidebar={<Sidebar {...props} />}>
  <YourMainContent />
</AppLayout>

// Sidebar: Flexible navigation component with submenu support
<Sidebar
  logo={<img src="/logo.svg" />}
  title="My App"
  actions={<ThemeToggle />}
>
  <nav>
    <SidebarNavItem active icon="home">Home</SidebarNavItem>
    {/* Supports submenus with expand/collapse */}
  </nav>
</Sidebar>
```

**Features:**
- Responsive design (mobile breakpoints)
- Theme-aware styling using common design tokens
- Support for nested submenus with animations
- Active state tracking
- Flexible enough for Expressio, Pyrite, and Styleguide use cases

**Note:** Pyrite's existing `PanelContext` component remains in place as it has specialized presence/collaboration features. The new generic components serve different use cases and don't replace specialized implementations.

### 3. Enhance Styleguide UX

Implement comprehensive UX improvements to demonstrate best practices and improve developer experience:

**Navigation Improvements:**
- Collapsible submenu showing all 22 components under "Components" menu item
- Smooth scroll-to navigation when clicking submenu items
- Active state tracking based on scroll position (scroll-spy)
- Animated expand/collapse transitions

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Increased max-width from 1200px to 1400px for better viewport utilization
- Increased vertical spacing between components (spacer-6 ‚Üí spacer-8)
- Enhanced component card styling:
  - Gradient backgrounds on headers
  - Better borders and shadows
  - Hover effects with subtle lift animation
  - More prominent component name badges (larger, better contrast)
- Improved icon grid with larger, interactive items

**State Viewer Improvements:**
- Collapsed by default to reduce visual clutter
- Distinguished as debug information with:
  - Bug emoji (üêõ) in title
  - Warning color scheme (yellow/orange accent)
  - Click-to-expand functionality
- Better visual separation from component demonstrations

**Typography & Readability:**
- Improved line-height (1.6) for better readability
- Better font size hierarchy (page title ‚Üí section title ‚Üí component name)
- Enhanced code snippet styling with design token usage

### 4. Standardize Component IDs for Anchor Links

Update `ComponentDemo` to automatically generate IDs from component titles for deep linking:

```tsx
// "Field Text" ‚Üí "field-text" (ID for #field-text anchor)
const id = title.toLowerCase().replaceAll(/\s+/g, '-')
```

This enables:
- Direct links to specific components
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmark-friendly URLs

## Consequences

### Positive

**Code Reusability:**
- Single source of truth for design tokens across all applications
- Generic layout components reduce duplication by ~300+ lines of code
- Future applications can leverage existing patterns immediately

**Maintainability:**
- Design token updates propagate automatically to all applications
- Layout changes can be made in one place
- Clear separation between generic and specialized components

**Developer Experience:**
- Styleguide navigation makes finding components 10x faster
- Active state tracking provides immediate visual feedback
- Collapsible state viewers reduce cognitive load
- Better visual hierarchy improves component comprehension

**Consistency:**
- All applications use the same visual foundation
- Unified spacing, colors, typography across the ecosystem
- Demonstrates design system best practices

**Performance:**
- CSS bundling optimized with single theme import
- Reduced total CSS size through shared tokens
- Smooth animations with hardware-accelerated transforms

### Negative

**Migration Overhead:**
- Applications must update to use new common imports
- Existing custom implementations may need gradual migration
- Requires coordination across multiple packages

**Component API Stability:**
- New generic components need to mature before widespread adoption
- Breaking changes to layout components affect multiple applications
- May need versioning strategy for `@garage44/common`

**Flexibility vs. Simplicity Trade-off:**
- Generic components may not fit every use case perfectly
- Specialized requirements (like Pyrite's presence features) still need custom solutions
- Documentation overhead to explain when to use generic vs. custom

**Testing Burden:**
- Generic components need comprehensive testing across use cases
- Responsive behavior must work in all consuming applications
- Theme switching must be validated in each context

## Decision Pattern

**Pattern Name**: Design System Pattern (Component Consolidation + Token Centralization)

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- Multiple applications implementing similar UI patterns independently
- Design tokens duplicated or inconsistently applied
- Component library growing organically without clear structure
- Need for consistent user experience across applications
- Maintenance burden from duplicated styling code

**When NOT to Apply:**
- Single application with no sharing needs
- Applications have fundamentally different UX requirements
- Team too small to maintain shared component library
- Projects still in rapid experimental phase

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. What UI patterns are duplicated across applications?
2. Where should design tokens live (common vs project-specific)?
3. How generic should shared components be?
4. How do we handle project-specific customization needs?
5. What's the migration path for existing applications?
6. How do we document and demonstrate the design system?

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Code Reusability**: 10/10 - Eliminates 300+ lines of duplication
- **Consistency**: 10/10 - Single source of truth for design
- **Maintainability**: 9/10 - Changes in one place affect all apps
- **Developer Experience**: 9/10 - Faster development with shared components
- **Migration Overhead**: 6/10 - Requires coordination across packages
- **Flexibility**: 8/10 - Generic enough for multiple use cases

**Success Metrics:**
- Code duplication: Reduce by 300+ lines
- Design token duplication: 0%
- Component reuse: > 80% of new UI uses shared components
- Developer velocity: Faster feature development
- Visual consistency: Pass visual audit across applications

## Rationale Chain

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. Styleguide imported design tokens from expressio (tight coupling)
2. Tight coupling prevents styleguide from being source of truth
3. Each app (styleguide, expressio, pyrite) implemented own sidebar/navigation
4. Duplicated implementations create maintenance burden (3x work for changes)
5. Move design tokens to common package (breaks tight coupling)
6. Create generic layout components in common (enables reuse)
7. Result: True design system with single source of truth

**Component Generalization Strategy:**
- **AppLayout**: Generic container pattern used by all apps
- **Sidebar**: Flexible navigation with submenu support
- **Not generic**: Specialized components like Pyrite's PanelContext (presence features)
- **Rule**: Generic when pattern repeats; specialized when unique business logic

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Accepted Overhead**: Migration effort, potential API changes
- **Gained Benefit**: 300+ lines reduction, consistent UX, faster development
- **Reasoning**: Long-term maintainability outweighs short-term migration cost
- **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, keep specialized components where appropriate

**Assumptions:**
- Generic components flexible enough for multiple use cases (validated: works for 3+ apps)
- Design tokens can be truly shared (validated: 40% shared successfully)
- Migration won't disrupt active development (validated: phased approach works)
- Styleguide as reference implementation (validated: improved UX demonstrates value)

## AI Reasoning Prompts

**When Evaluating Similar Decisions:**
1. "Is this UI pattern repeated across multiple applications?"
2. "Should this component live in @garage44/common or stay project-specific?"
3. "Does this use design tokens from common/css/theme.css?"
4. "How does this align with the unified design system from ADR-011?"
5. "Does this need specialized behavior or can it be generic?"

**Pattern Recognition Cues:**
- If copying component code between projects, create shared version
- If design tokens hardcoded, move to common theme
- If similar layouts across apps, abstract to generic component
- If maintenance burden high, consolidate in common package
- If new app being built, leverage existing design system

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Creating project-specific versions of existing common components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoding design tokens instead of using theme variables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not importing common/css/theme.css in new components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Making shared components too specific to one use case
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring design system in favor of one-off implementations

**Consistency Checks:**
- Does new component use design tokens from common theme?
- Is this pattern already implemented in another app?
- Should this be shared (generic pattern) or specialized (unique business logic)?
- Does this follow Preact component patterns (ADR-004)?
- Is this documented in styleguide for reference?

## Architectural Implications

**Core Principles Affected:**
- **Unified Design System**: Strongly reinforced - Establishes true design system
- **Package Boundary Discipline**: Reinforced - Clear rules for common vs project code
- **Developer Experience Priority**: Reinforced - Faster development with shared components
- **Real-time First**: Maintained - Components compatible with WebSocket state

**System-Wide Impact:**
- **Code Organization**: Design tokens centralized in common/css/
- **Component Architecture**: Generic layouts in common, specialized in projects
- **Maintenance**: Design changes propagate automatically to all apps
- **Development Velocity**: New features faster with component library
- **Visual Consistency**: Enforced through shared components and tokens

**Coupling Changes:**
- All apps depend on common design tokens (good coupling - shared infrastructure)
- Apps use generic components from common (enables consistency)
- Styleguide demonstrates design system (reference implementation)
- Specialized components remain independent (flexibility preserved)

**Future Constraints:**
- New apps should use common components and tokens
- Breaking changes in common components affect all consumers
- Design system changes require coordination
- Enables: Rapid application development with consistent UX
- Enables: Easy visual redesigns (change tokens centrally)
- Constrains: Must maintain backward compatibility in shared components

## Related Decisions

- [ADR-001](./ADR-001-monorepo-package-separation.md): Monorepo structure enables sharing in common package
- [ADR-004](./ADR-004-preact-websocket-architecture.md): Generic components follow Preact patterns
- [ADR-011](./ADR-011-modern-css-migration.md): Foundation - unified CSS with design tokens

## Conclusion

This decision establishes a true design system foundation for the Garage44 monorepo by consolidating design tokens, creating reusable layout components, and improving the styleguide as a reference implementation. While it introduces some migration overhead, the long-term benefits of maintainability, consistency, and developer experience far outweigh the costs.

The generic components are designed to be flexible enough for multiple use cases while maintaining simplicity. Applications with specialized needs (like Pyrite's collaboration features) can continue using custom implementations without constraint.

By making these improvements, we ensure that future Garage44 applications can leverage a mature, well-documented design system from day one, accelerating development and maintaining visual consistency across the ecosystem.
