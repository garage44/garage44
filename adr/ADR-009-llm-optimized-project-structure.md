## Status
Partially Implemented (ADR system enhanced 2025-10-16, strategy docs pending)

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context

As LLMs become increasingly involved in software development and strategic decision-making, we need to consider how project structure affects their ability to reason about:

1. **Technical Evolution**: Understanding current architecture and suggesting improvements
2. **Feature Development**: Identifying gaps and opportunities in the product
3. **Market Positioning**: Analyzing competitive landscape and user needs
4. **Community Building**: Understanding stakeholder relationships and growth strategies

Traditional project documentation often scatters strategic context across multiple files, making it difficult for LLMs to build coherent mental models of the project's trajectory and potential.

## Decision

Implement an LLM-optimized project structure that explicitly supports strategic reasoning by:

### 1. **LLM-Generated Strategic Context**
- Use LLMs to write and maintain `docs/strategy/` documents
- Leverage LLMs' ability to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Enable continuous strategic analysis and updates through AI assistance
- Maintain human oversight and validation of strategic direction

### 2. **Decision Traceability**
- Link ADRs to strategic goals and market conditions
- Maintain decision trees showing how technical choices support business objectives
- Document rejected alternatives with reasoning for future reference
- Use ADRs as the primary decision documentation (no separate decisions directory)

### 3. **Market and User Context**
- Create structured personas and use case documents
- Maintain competitive analysis in machine-readable formats
- Document user feedback patterns and feature requests systematically
- Enable LLMs to identify patterns and trends in user behavior

### 4. **Community and Ecosystem Mapping**
- Document stakeholder relationships and dependencies
- Track community engagement metrics and growth patterns
- Maintain ecosystem integration opportunities and partnerships
- Use LLMs to analyze community sentiment and engagement trends

### 5. **LLM-Friendly Documentation Patterns**
- Use consistent section headers and metadata tags
- Include explicit reasoning chains and decision criteria
- Maintain chronological context for evolution tracking
- Provide clear success metrics and evaluation criteria

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved LLM Reasoning**: Structured context enables better strategic analysis
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members and AI assistants can quickly understand project trajectory
- **Better Decision Making**: Clear traceability between technical and business decisions
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Centralized strategic information reduces cognitive load
- **Future-Proofing**: Structured data enables automated analysis and trend detection
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: LLMs handle information synthesis while humans provide oversight
- **Continuous Strategic Analysis**: AI can continuously analyze and update strategic context

### Negative
- **LLM Dependency**: Risk of over-reliance on AI-generated strategic content
- **Quality Control**: Need for human validation of AI-generated strategic documents
- **Context Drift**: AI-generated content may drift from original project vision
- **Tool Dependency**: Reliance on specific documentation formats and LLM capabilities

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **Human Oversight Framework**
- Regular human review of AI-generated strategic content
- Clear approval workflows for strategic document updates
- Version control and change tracking for strategic documents
- Human validation of critical strategic decisions

### 2. **Hybrid Content Generation**
- Use LLMs for initial drafts and analysis
- Human experts provide final validation and approval
- Collaborative editing between humans and AI
- Clear attribution of AI vs human contributions

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated consistency checks for strategic documents
- Cross-reference validation between technical and strategic decisions
- Regular audits of AI-generated content accuracy
- Feedback loops to improve LLM strategic reasoning

### 4. **Flexible Documentation Standards**
- Allow for creative exploration while maintaining structure
- Regular review and update of documentation standards
- Balance between automation and human creativity
- Adapt documentation patterns based on project evolution

## Decision Pattern

**Pattern Name**: Process Change Pattern (AI/LLM Integration)

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- Integrating AI/LLM tools into development workflow
- Optimizing documentation for AI consumption
- Creating feedback loops between human decisions and AI learning
- Building systems that improve through AI-assisted iteration

**When NOT to Apply:**
- Project has no AI/LLM involvement
- Documentation complexity outweighs benefits
- Team lacks capacity to maintain AI-optimized structures
- Privacy/security concerns prevent AI access to documentation

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. How will LLMs access and use this documentation?
2. What decisions do we want LLMs to make better?
3. How do we maintain human oversight and validation?
4. What's the feedback loop for improving AI reasoning?
5. How do we balance structure with flexibility?

**Decision Criteria:**
- **AI Value Add**: 10/10 - LLMs significantly improve decision quality
- **Human Oversight**: 9/10 - Critical decisions still require human validation
- **Maintainability**: 7/10 - Requires discipline to maintain structure
- **Team Buy-in**: 8/10 - Team must understand and embrace AI collaboration
- **Documentation Overhead**: 6/10 - More structured documentation required
- **Long-term Impact**: 10/10 - Compounds over time as AI learns patterns

**Success Metrics:**
- LLM decision quality: Improved architectural consistency
- Decision velocity: Faster, better-informed decisions
- Pattern reuse: LLMs successfully apply existing patterns
- Human validation rate: >80% of AI suggestions accepted
- Documentation freshness: Regular updates with learnings

## Rationale Chain

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. We chose LLM optimization because AI assistants (like Cursor) are core to our workflow
2. AI in workflow enables faster development and better decisions
3. Better decisions require AI to understand architectural context
4. Understanding context requires structured, machine-readable documentation
5. Structured documentation enables pattern recognition and extrapolation
6. Pattern recognition allows AI to apply lessons from past decisions to new situations
7. This creates a virtuous cycle: decisions → documentation → learning → better future decisions

**Two-Phase Approach Reasoning:**
- **Phase 1 (Implemented)**: ADR optimization for architectural decisions
  - Highest immediate value (decisions happen frequently)
  - Clear structure (ADRs have established format)
  - Direct workflow integration (Cursor consults during planning)
  - Measurable impact (can validate decision consistency)

- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Strategic documentation for business decisions
  - Longer-term value (strategic decisions less frequent)
  - Less structured format (strategy is more fluid)
  - Requires different integration points
  - Harder to measure impact

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Accepted Overhead**: More structured documentation, metadata maintenance
- **Gained Benefit**: Significantly better AI architectural reasoning, accumulated wisdom
- **Reasoning**: Time invested in documentation pays compound returns through better AI assistance
- **Mitigation**: Templates and patterns reduce per-decision overhead

**Assumptions:**
- LLMs will continue improving in reasoning capability (validated: rapid progress in 2023-2025)
- Structured documentation helps AI more than it hinders humans (validated: improved onboarding)
- Team will maintain documentation discipline (needs validation: ongoing monitoring required)
- AI-generated suggestions improve with better context (validated: enhanced ADRs show improvement)

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
```markdown
// ❌ Don't create documentation that only AI can read
// Humans must be able to understand and validate

// ❌ Don't trust AI blindly
// Human oversight required for significant decisions

// ❌ Don't over-structure to the point of rigidity
// Balance structure with flexibility for edge cases

// ✅ Do create documentation useful for both humans and AI
// Clear prose + structured metadata

// ✅ Do maintain feedback loops
// Document what worked / didn't work

// ✅ Do evolve based on usage
// Adjust templates and patterns as we learn
```

## AI Reasoning Prompts

**When Evaluating Similar Decisions:**
1. "How will AI/LLMs interact with this system?"
2. "What structure helps AI understand context better?"
3. "How do we ensure human oversight remains central?"
4. "What's the feedback loop for improving AI assistance?"
5. "Does this align with the 'LLM-Optimized Strategic Reasoning' principle?"

**Pattern Recognition Cues:**
- If AI assistants are core to workflow, optimize documentation for them
- If decisions repeat with patterns, document patterns explicitly
- If onboarding is slow, structure may help both humans and AI
- If architectural drift occurs, AI might not have sufficient context

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ Documentation too complex for humans to maintain (defeats purpose)
- ⚠️ AI making decisions without human validation (unsafe)
- ⚠️ Patterns not being reused despite documentation (structure failing)
- ⚠️ Documentation becoming stale (feedback loop broken)

**Consistency Checks:**
- Are new ADRs using the enhanced template?
- Are LLMs citing specific ADRs in plans?
- Are patterns being applied consistently?
- Is the feedback loop functioning (Plan → Build → ADR)?

## Architectural Implications

**Core Principles Affected:**
- **LLM-Optimized Strategic Reasoning**: Established - This decision creates this principle
- **Developer Experience Priority**: Reinforced - Better AI assistance improves DX
- **Package Boundary Discipline**: Supported - AI can enforce boundaries with proper context
- **Real-time First**: Indirectly supported - AI can guide communication pattern choices

**System-Wide Impact:**
- **Decision Making**: AI-assisted decision making becomes standard workflow
- **Documentation**: All significant decisions documented for AI learning
- **Onboarding**: New developers and AI assistants both benefit from structured docs
- **Consistency**: AI helps maintain architectural consistency across features
- **Evolution**: System learns and improves from documented lessons

**Coupling Changes:**
- Development workflow now coupled to AI assistant capabilities (acceptable dependency)
- Documentation structure coupled to AI reasoning patterns (enables benefits)
- Decision quality coupled to documentation quality (virtuous cycle)

**Future Constraints:**
- Documentation must remain AI-readable as AI systems evolve
- Changes to documentation structure require retraining/adapting AI prompts
- Team must maintain discipline in documenting decisions
- Enables: Rapid AI-assisted development with consistent architecture
- Enables: Accumulated organizational wisdom accessible to AI
- Constrains: Documentation overhead for all significant decisions
