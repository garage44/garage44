## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-04-17 (from initial project setup)

## Context

The project needed a JavaScript runtime and package manager. The main options considered were:

- **Node.js + npm/yarn**: Traditional, mature ecosystem
- **Node.js + pnpm**: Better monorepo support, faster installs
- **Bun**: Modern runtime with built-in bundling, faster startup times
- **Deno**: Modern runtime with TypeScript support, different module system

Key requirements:
- Fast development iteration cycles
- Built-in TypeScript support without complex build setup
- Good monorepo workspace support
- Fast package installation
- Modern JavaScript features (ES2023)
- Integrated bundling for frontend builds

## Decision

Adopt Bun as the primary runtime and package manager for the entire Expressio project.

**Runtime Configuration:**
- Target ES2023 for modern JavaScript features
- Use `type: "module"` for ES modules throughout
- Configure TypeScript with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`
- Leverage Bun's built-in bundler for frontend builds

**Development Workflow:**
- `bun run dev` for development with hot reload
- `bun run build` for production builds
- Bun workspaces for monorepo dependency management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Development Speed**: Significantly faster startup times and package installs
- **Simplified Toolchain**: Built-in bundler eliminates webpack/vite configuration
- **TypeScript Integration**: Native TypeScript execution without transpilation step
- **Modern Standards**: ES2023 support, modern module resolution
- **Monorepo Support**: Excellent workspace dependency handling
- **Single Tool**: Runtime, package manager, and bundler in one

### Negative
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js
- **Package Compatibility**: Some npm packages may have compatibility issues
- **Production Risk**: Less battle-tested in production environments
- **Team Knowledge**: Team needs to learn Bun-specific features and quirks
- **CI/CD Setup**: May need special setup in some CI environments

## Implementation Notes
- All packages use `"type": "module"` in package.json
- TypeScript configured with bundler module resolution
- Bun-specific types added to development dependencies
- Development scripts use `bun run --watch` for hot reload
- Production builds use Bun's built-in bundler

## Monitoring
- Track any package compatibility issues
- Monitor build performance improvements
- Watch for production stability issues
- Keep Node.js as fallback option if needed

## Future Considerations
- Consider Node.js compatibility layer if ecosystem issues arise
- Monitor Bun ecosystem maturity and adoption
- Evaluate migration path if runtime change becomes necessary

## Decision Pattern

**Pattern Name**: Technology Adoption Pattern (Runtime/Infrastructure)

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- Choosing a JavaScript runtime for a new project
- Replacing existing runtime for performance/DX improvements
- Evaluating modern alternatives to established technologies

**When NOT to Apply:**
- Project requires maximum ecosystem compatibility
- Team lacks capacity for potential troubleshooting
- Production stability is critical with zero tolerance for runtime issues

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. What specific performance or DX problems does this solve?
2. Is the ecosystem mature enough for our use case?
3. Can we validate benefits with proof-of-concept?
4. What's our fallback if this technology proves problematic?
5. How does the team feel about learning curve and change?

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Developer Experience**: 9/10 - Fast startup, built-in TypeScript, simple tooling
- **Performance**: 8/10 - Measurable improvements in build/install times
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: 7/10 - Growing but not as mature as Node.js
- **Team Knowledge**: 6/10 - New but similar to Node.js
- **Future Viability**: 8/10 - Active development, growing adoption
- **Migration Cost**: 7/10 - Moderate effort, clear migration path

**Success Metrics:**
- Build time: Target 2-5x improvement
- Package install time: Target 10x+ improvement
- Developer satisfaction: Positive team feedback within 1 month
- Production stability: Zero runtime-related incidents in first quarter

## Rationale Chain

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. We chose Bun because it eliminates build complexity (native TypeScript execution)
2. Native TypeScript enables faster iteration cycles
3. Faster iteration improves developer productivity
4. Built-in bundler eliminates webpack/vite configuration overhead
5. Reduced toolchain complexity lowers cognitive load
6. Fast package installs reduce waiting time in development

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Accepted Risk**: Smaller ecosystem and less production battle-testing
- **Gained Benefit**: 10x faster package installs, 2-3x faster startup times
- **Reasoning**: Developer experience gains outweigh ecosystem risk for our use case
- **Mitigation**: Maintain Node.js as documented fallback option

**Assumptions:**
- Bun ecosystem will continue maturing (validated: active development, growing community)
- Critical npm packages will work in Bun (validated: tested key dependencies)
- Team can adapt to Bun-specific features (validated: similar to Node.js, low learning curve)
- Performance gains will materialize in real projects (validated: measured 5-10x improvements)

## Code Context

**Files Affected (Package Configuration):**
- `/packages/*/package.json` - All packages use `"type": "module"`
- `/packages/*/tsconfig.json` - Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`
- `bun.lock` - Bun-specific lockfile (replaces package-lock.json)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```json
// package.json - Standard Bun configuration
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --watch service.ts",
    "build": "bun build src/index.ts --outdir=public"
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Direct TypeScript execution - no build step needed
import { serve } from "bun";

const server = serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("Hello from Bun!");
  },
});
```

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
```javascript
// ❌ Don't use Node.js-specific APIs without checking compatibility
const fs = require('fs'); // CommonJS - use import instead

// ❌ Don't assume all npm packages work (test first)
// Some packages with native bindings may have issues

// ✅ Do use Bun-native APIs when available
import { file } from "bun";
const data = await file("data.json").json();

// ✅ Do use ES modules consistently
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";
```

**Migration Path:**
1. Update all `package.json` files to `"type": "module"`
2. Configure TypeScript with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`
3. Install dependencies with `bun install`
4. Update scripts to use `bun run` instead of `npm run`
5. Test all critical dependencies for compatibility
6. Update CI/CD to use Bun runtime
7. Document any incompatible packages and workarounds

## AI Reasoning Prompts

**When Evaluating Similar Decisions:**
1. "Does this technology provide measurable 2-5x improvements in key metrics?"
2. "How does the ecosystem maturity compare to Bun's when we adopted it?"
3. "Can we validate benefits with a small proof-of-concept first?"
4. "What's our fallback plan if this technology causes production issues?"
5. "Does this align with our 'Developer Experience Priority' principle?"

**Pattern Recognition Cues:**
- If proposing runtime/infrastructure changes, apply this pattern
- If seeking performance improvements through tooling, consider this approach
- If team complains about slow build times, review this decision's reasoning
- If evaluating modern alternatives to Node.js, reference this ADR

**Red Flags:**
- ⚠️ Proposing to switch away from Bun without clear justification (contradicts this decision)
- ⚠️ Using Node.js-specific APIs that don't work in Bun (check compatibility)
- ⚠️ Installing packages without testing Bun compatibility first
- ⚠️ Ignoring Bun-native APIs in favor of slower alternatives

**Consistency Checks:**
- Does this use Bun's built-in bundler (ADR-007) or introduce new bundler?
- Does this maintain ES module structure established here?
- Does this leverage Bun's performance characteristics?
- Is this compatible with Bun workspaces (ADR-001)?

## Architectural Implications

**Core Principles Affected:**
- **Developer Experience Priority**: Reinforced - Bun's fast iteration directly supports this principle
- **Package Boundary Discipline**: Reinforced - Bun workspaces make monorepo boundaries clearer
- **Commercial/Community Balance**: Neutral - Runtime choice doesn't affect licensing

**System-Wide Impact:**
- **Build System**: Bun's built-in bundler simplifies entire build pipeline (see ADR-007)
- **Package Management**: Bun workspaces handle monorepo dependencies efficiently
- **Module System**: ES modules only - no CommonJS complexity
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload and fast startup improve iteration speed
- **CI/CD**: CI pipelines need Bun installation, but builds are faster

**Coupling Changes:**
- All packages now depend on Bun runtime (acceptable infrastructure dependency)
- Reduced coupling to external build tools (webpack, vite no longer needed)
- Tighter coupling to Bun ecosystem (mitigated by maintaining Node.js compatibility)

**Future Constraints:**
- Projects must target modern ES2023 features (no legacy JavaScript)
- New packages must use ES modules consistently
- Third-party packages must be Bun-compatible (test before adding)
- CI/CD providers must support Bun runtime
- Enables future use of Bun-specific features (native SQLite, WebSocket, etc.)
