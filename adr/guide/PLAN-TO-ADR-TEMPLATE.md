# Plan-to-ADR Conversion Template

This guide provides a structured workflow for converting approved Cursor plans into Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). This ensures the feedback loop: **Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí ADR ‚Üí Learning**.

## When to Convert a Plan to an ADR

Convert a plan to an ADR when:
- ‚úÖ Plan was approved and successfully implemented
- ‚úÖ Decision has architectural significance (see AI-REASONING-GUIDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Pattern or approach should be reused in future decisions
- ‚úÖ Decision affects multiple components or establishes precedent

## Conversion Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (During Planning)

**1. Flag ADR Need in Plan**

In your plan, include an "ADR Candidate" section:
```markdown
## ADR Candidate

**Decision Type**: technology_choice | architecture_pattern | tool_adoption | process_change
**Significance**: High | Medium | Low
**Rationale**: [Why this deserves an ADR]
**Related ADRs**: [Existing ADRs this builds on or modifies]
```

**2. Reference Existing ADRs**

Always cite relevant ADRs in the plan:
```markdown
## Architectural Alignment

Following ADR-003 (Bun Runtime), we should...
This builds on ADR-004 (WebSocket Architecture) by...
Deviates from ADR-010 because...
```

### Phase 2: During Implementation

**1. Track Actual Decisions**

Keep notes on:
- What worked as planned
- What required adjustment
- Unexpected challenges
- Better approaches discovered
- Performance measurements
- Code patterns that emerged

**2. Document Code Context**

Track:
- Files created/modified
- Implementation patterns used
- Anti-patterns avoided
- Migration steps taken

### Phase 3: Post-Implementation (Creating ADR)

## Step-by-Step Conversion Guide

### Step 1: Extract Metadata

**From Plan:**
```markdown
Plan: "Migrate CSS from SCSS to native modern CSS"
Tags: frontend, tooling, design-system
Impact: expressio, pyrite, styleguide
Related: Build system changes, design tokens
```

**To ADR Metadata:**
```markdown
---
id: ADR-011
title: Modern CSS Migration and Unified Styleguide
status: Accepted
date: 2025-10-11
tags: [frontend, infrastructure, tooling, ux]
impact_areas: [expressio, pyrite, common, styleguide]
decision_type: tool_adoption | architecture_pattern
related_decisions: [ADR-003, ADR-004]
supersedes: []
superseded_by: []
---
```

### Step 2: Map Plan Sections to ADR Sections

| Plan Section | ADR Section | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Overview/Goal | Context | Expand with why this was needed |
| Approach | Decision | Add what was actually decided |
| Implementation Steps | Code Context | Show actual files and patterns |
| Risks/Considerations | Consequences (Negative) | Include actual issues encountered |
| Benefits | Consequences (Positive) | Include measured results |
| Alternatives Considered | Rationale Chain | Expand with deeper analysis |
| Success Criteria | Decision Pattern (Metrics) | Add actual results achieved |

### Step 3: Add ADR-Specific Sections

These sections don't exist in plans but are crucial for ADRs:

**Decision Pattern:**
```markdown
## Decision Pattern

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- [Extract from: When would someone face a similar decision?]

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. [What questions led to this decision?]
2. [What criteria were most important?]
3. [What validated the decision?]

**Decision Criteria:**
- [Criterion 1]: [Weight] - [How it was evaluated]
```

**Rationale Chain:**
```markdown
## Rationale Chain

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. We chose [X] because [Y]
2. [Y] enables [Z]
3. [Z] addresses the core problem of [W]

**Alternatives Considered:**
[From plan, but expand with specific rejection reasons]

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- We accepted [cost] to gain [benefit] because [reason]
```

**AI Reasoning Prompts:**
```markdown
## AI Reasoning Prompts

**When Evaluating Similar Decisions:**
1. "[Question that would help LLM in future]"
2. "[Pattern recognition cue]"

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Warning sign that indicates misapplication]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [Sign that suggests reconsidering approach]
```

**Architectural Implications:**
```markdown
## Architectural Implications

**Core Principles Affected:**
- [Principle from README.md]: Reinforced/Modified - How

**System-Wide Impact:**
- Package Boundaries: [How this affected separation]
- Communication Patterns: [Changes to data flow]
```

### Step 4: Add Retrospective Analysis

This is NEW information not in the original plan:

**What Actually Happened:**
```markdown
## Evolution Log

**Initial Implementation** (YYYY-MM-DD):
[Describe what was actually built]

**Lessons Learned:**
- ‚úÖ [What worked better than expected]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [What was more challenging than anticipated]
- üí° [What we'd do differently next time]
- üìä [Actual metrics vs predicted]

**Unexpected Outcomes:**
- [Positive surprises]
- [Challenges not anticipated in plan]
- [Emergent patterns or practices]
```

### Step 5: Quantify Results

Add actual measurements where plan had estimates:

**Plan Said:**
> "Expected 2-5x performance improvement"

**ADR Shows:**
> "Build time reduced from 2s to 0.3s (6.6x faster)"

**Plan Said:**
> "Should reduce bundle size"

**ADR Shows:**
> "Bundle size reduced from 110KB to 80KB (27% reduction)"

## Complete Conversion Example

### Original Plan (Abbreviated)

```markdown
# Modern CSS Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrate from SCSS to native CSS for better performance and simpler build.

## Approach
- Move design tokens to common package
- Convert SCSS nesting to native CSS nesting
- Use OKLCH for color system

## Benefits
- Faster builds
- Simpler toolchain
- Better design system sharing

## Risks
- Browser compatibility (need modern browsers)
- Team learning curve
```

### Converted to ADR (Key Sections)

```markdown
---
id: ADR-011
title: Modern CSS Migration and Unified Styleguide
status: Accepted
date: 2025-10-11
tags: [frontend, infrastructure, tooling, ux]
impact_areas: [expressio, pyrite, common, styleguide]
decision_type: tool_adoption | architecture_pattern
related_decisions: [ADR-003]
---

## Context

The monorepo had multiple applications using SCSS independently, creating:
- Inconsistent design systems across projects
- Duplication of design tokens
- Complex build process requiring preprocessing
- Opportunity: Modern browsers now support native CSS nesting

[Much more detail than plan...]

## Decision

Migrate all projects from SCSS to modern native CSS with unified design system...

[Implementation details from actual work...]

## Decision Pattern

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- Migrating from preprocessor to native browser features
- Establishing shared design system across applications
- Simplifying build toolchain

**Key Questions:**
1. Do target browsers support required features?
2. What design tokens should be shared vs project-specific?
3. How to migrate incrementally without disrupting development?

**Decision Criteria:**
- Browser support: 8/10 (modern browsers only)
- Design system unification: 10/10 (critical need)
- Migration effort: 7/10 (significant but manageable)

## Rationale Chain

**Primary Reasoning:**
1. Native CSS nesting eliminates primary need for SCSS
2. Shared design tokens in common package enable consistency
3. Bun's native CSS bundler is faster than SCSS preprocessing
4. Single `theme.css` import simplifies consumption

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep SCSS: Rejected due to build complexity and duplication
- Tailwind: Rejected due to bundle size and token control
- CSS-in-JS: Rejected due to runtime cost and complexity

[More detail than plan...]

## Code Context

**Files Created:**
- `/packages/common/css/theme.css` - Unified theme entry point
- `/packages/common/css/_variables.css` - Shared design tokens
[From actual implementation...]

**Implementation Pattern:**
```css
/* ‚úÖ Single import pattern */
@import "../../../common/css/theme.css";
```

**Anti-patterns:**
```css
/* ‚ùå Don't import individual files */
@import "../../../common/css/_variables.css";
@import "../../../common/css/_typography.css";
```

[From actual code...]

## AI Reasoning Prompts

**When Evaluating Similar Decisions:**
1. "Does this align with ADR-003's developer experience priority?"
2. "Can native browser features replace this preprocessor?"
3. "How does this affect design system consistency?"

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Proposing SCSS in new components (contradicts this decision)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not using common design tokens (breaks consistency)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requiring older browser support (incompatible)

## Evolution Log

**Initial Implementation** (2025-10-11):
- Migrated Expressio and Pyrite successfully
- Created unified `theme.css` entry point

**Lessons Learned:**
- ‚úÖ Native CSS nesting worked seamlessly
- ‚úÖ Single import pattern much better than anticipated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OKLCH required more documentation than expected
- üìä Build performance: 6.6x faster (exceeded 2-5x estimate)
- üìä Bundle size: 27% reduction (better than expected)

**Unexpected Benefits:**
- Hot reload significantly faster (10x improvement)
- Design token changes propagate instantly
- Developers prefer native CSS in DevTools (no source maps)

**Adjustment Recommendations:**
- Document OKLCH color space better for team
- Create visual design token documentation
- Consider CSS layers for better cascade control
```

## Common Mapping Patterns

### Plan: "Overview" ‚Üí ADR: "Context"

**Expand with:**
- Historical context (what led to this point)
- Business drivers and constraints
- Current state pain points
- Attempted solutions that didn't work

### Plan: "Approach" ‚Üí ADR: "Decision"

**Expand with:**
- Precise technical choices made
- Configuration specifics
- Integration points
- Actual implementation decisions made during development

### Plan: "Implementation Steps" ‚Üí ADR: "Code Context"

**Transform to:**
- Actual files created/modified (not planned files)
- Real code patterns that emerged
- Anti-patterns discovered during implementation
- Migration steps that actually worked

### Plan: "Benefits/Risks" ‚Üí ADR: "Consequences"

**Enhance with:**
- Quantified results (actual measurements)
- Unexpected positive outcomes
- Issues that manifested (or didn't)
- Long-term implications observed

## ADR Review Checklist

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Add depth beyond original plan
- Include actual measurements
- Document what you learned
- Extract reusable patterns
- Write while implementation is fresh
- Focus on architecturally significant decisions
- Make AI Reasoning Prompts actionable
