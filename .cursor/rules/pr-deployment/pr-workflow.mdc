# Pull Request Workflow

Guidelines for creating and reviewing pull requests.

## PR Creation Guidelines

**Before Creating a PR:**
1. ✅ Ensure all lint checks pass locally: `bun run lint:ts && bun run lint:css`
2. ✅ Run tests: `bun run test`
3. ✅ Build successfully: `bun run build`
4. ✅ Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
5. ✅ Update documentation if needed
6. ✅ Follow commit message conventions

**PR Title Format:**
- Use descriptive titles: `feat: Add translation batch processing`
- Prefix with type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Reference issue numbers if applicable: `fix: Resolve WebSocket reconnection issue (#123)`

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## PR Review Process

**For Reviewers:**
- Check that code follows architectural patterns (see `adr.mdc`)
- Verify backend uses Bun.serve() patterns (not Express.js)
- Verify frontend uses Preact + DeepSignal patterns
- Ensure WebSocket patterns are correct (server/client)
- Check CSS uses modern nesting (not BEM)
- Verify no CSS imports in components (Bunchy handles this)
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Check for security concerns (input validation, path sanitization)

**For Authors:**
- Address all review comments
- Keep PRs updated with main branch
- Don't force push to PR branches (unless rebasing)
- Respond to review feedback promptly

## Branch Naming Conventions

- Feature branches: `feature/description` or `feat/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description` or `bugfix/description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Refactoring: `refactor/description`

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-batch-translation`
- `fix/websocket-reconnection`
- `docs/update-deployment-guide`
