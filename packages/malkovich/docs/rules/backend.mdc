# Garage44 Backend Development Rules

Backend development guidelines for the Expressio AI-powered i18n tooling project.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun (modern JavaScript runtime)
- **Server**: Bun.serve() with custom routing - NOT Express.js
- **Architecture**: Service-oriented with dependency injection
- **CLI**: yargs-based command interface
- **Logging**: Custom isomorphic logger service
- **Config**: RC file-based configuration management

## Project Structure (Backend Focus)

```
packages/
├── expressio/
│   ├── api/           # REST API endpoints
│   ├── lib/           # Core business logic
│   └── service.ts     # CLI entry point
├── bunchy/            # Development tooling
└── common/            # Shared backend utilities
```

## Code Style and ESLint Compliance

**🚨 CRITICAL: See `@linting.mdc` for complete linting requirements.**

**All code must pass ESLint checks before committing.**

### Before Committing

Always run lint checks and fix any errors before committing:

```bash
# Check TypeScript files
bun run lint:ts
```

**Auto-fixing:**
- Many formatting issues can be auto-fixed: `bun run lint:ts --fix`
- Always verify auto-fixes don't break functionality
- Fix any remaining errors manually according to ESLint output

**ESLint configuration:**
- Rules are defined in `eslint.config.js` at the workspace root
- Follow ESLint error messages to fix code style issues
- Do not commit code with linting errors

**For detailed linting rules and workflow, see `@linting.mdc`.**

## Common Anti-patterns

❌ **Don't do:**
- Use Express.js patterns - this is Bun with custom routing
- Block the main thread with synchronous file operations
- Store sensitive API keys in workspace files
- Skip input validation on user-provided paths
- Ignore WebSocket connection cleanup
- Commit code without running lint checks

✅ **Do:**
- Use Bun.serve() and native Web APIs (Request/Response)
- Leverage Bun's fast file I/O with async operations
- Use environment variables or rc config file for sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all file paths and user inputs
- Use the websocket protocol
- Use structured logging with relevant context
- Always run `bun run lint:ts` before committing
