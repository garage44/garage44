# Garage44 Cursor AI Rules

Organized modular rules for the Garage44 monorepo AI assistant.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Linting Requirements

**BEFORE making any code changes, read `.cursor/rules/linting.mdc` - it contains mandatory linting requirements.**

All code MUST pass linting checks (`bun run lint:ts` and `bun run lint:css`) before being committed. Agents should fix linting errors proactively, not rely on git hooks.

## Rule Organization

Cursor rules are organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory for better modularity and context-aware activation:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── linting.mdc      # 🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory linting requirements (READ FIRST)
├── adr.mdc          # Architecture Decision Records consultation workflow
├── backend.mdc      # Backend development (Bun.serve, WebSocket server, CLI)
├── frontend.mdc     # Frontend development (Preact, DeepSignal, WebSocket client)
└── pr-deployment.mdc # PR deployment testing workflow
```

## Quick Reference

- **🚨 LINTING (READ FIRST)**: See `.cursor/rules/linting.mdc` - mandatory linting requirements
- **Architecture & Decisions**: See `.cursor/rules/adr.mdc` and `adr/README.md`
- **Backend Development**: See `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc`
- **Frontend Development**: See `.cursor/rules/frontend.mdc`
- **PR Deployment Testing**: See `.cursor/rules/pr-deployment.mdc`

All rules use YAML frontmatter with glob patterns and are applied automatically based on context.

**Note**: This root `.cursorrules` file serves as an entry point. The detailed rules are in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for better organization and maintainability.
