# Garage44 Cursor AI Rules

Organized modular rules for the Garage44 monorepo AI assistant.

## Rule Organization

Cursor rules are organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory for better modularity and context-aware activation:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── adr.mdc          # Architecture Decision Records consultation workflow
├── backend.mdc      # Backend development (Bun.serve, WebSocket server, CLI)
└── frontend.mdc     # Frontend development (Preact, DeepSignal, WebSocket client)
```

## Quick Reference

- **Architecture & Decisions**: See `.cursor/rules/adr.mdc` and `adr/README.md`
- **Backend Development**: See `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc`
- **Frontend Development**: See `.cursor/rules/frontend.mdc`

All rules use YAML frontmatter with glob patterns and are applied automatically based on context.

**Note**: This root `.cursorrules` file serves as an entry point. The detailed rules are in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for better organization and maintainability.
